~~~~# execution_engine2

  
This is a [KBase](https://kbase.us) module generated by the [KBase Software Development Kit (SDK)](https://github.com/kbase/kb_sdk).  
  
You will need to have the SDK installed to use this module. [Learn more about the SDK and how to use it](https://kbase.github.io/kb_sdk_docs/).  
  
You can also learn more about the apps implemented in this module from its [catalog page](https://narrative.kbase.us/#catalog/modules/execution_engine2) or its [spec file]($module_name.spec).  
  
# Setup and test  
  
See the .travis file for information on how to test  
  
* modify test/example.env to add your token/endpoint for api tests  
* modify test/example.env to add test/deploy.cfg path  
* copy the test/example.env into test/test.env  
  
# Test Running Options  
  
## Run tests on local machine without docker (not recommended)  
### Attempt to install all dependencies  
* python3 -m venv venv && source venv && pip install -r requirements.txt  
  
* make test  
* make test-models  
  
### If you cannot install dependencies on your local machine, install your python interpreter into a docker container  
#### test/dockerfiles/condor/  
  
#### For light testing just htcondor bindings  
* Ensure requirements.txt is up to date  
```  
cd test/dockerfiles/condor/  
docker build -f DockerfileForInterpreter . -t ee2_dev  
docker run -ti -d --privileged=true -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro -v /Users:/Users  ee2_dev  
```  
  
  
#### For full testing, including the ability for containers to be networked  
* Ensure requirements.txt is up to date  
* Ensure docker-compose.env is populated  
```  
cd /test/dockerfiles/condor  
docker build -f Dockerfile . -t kbase/ee2:local_condor  
#docker push kbase/ee2:local_condor  
docker-compose up -d  
```  
  
  
# Installation from another module  
  
To use this code in another SDK module, call `kb-sdk install execution_engine2` in the other module's root directory.
